## About us

SignPath was founded in 2017 as a subsidiary of RUBICON IT GmbH - a leading European software development company headquartered in Vienna, Austria. Coming from the software community, we have extensively researched the code signing ecosystem and created a solution that allows our customers to integrate code signing into their software development process. We are constantly adding new signing methods, more secure algorithms and improved process definitions to make code signing as simple and secure as possible.

## Vision

At SignPath, we believe that signing code is crucial for secure distribution of software artifacts. Increased frequency of releases make it even more important that the origin of every shipped code is verifiable. Therefore we are developing the world's leading code signing solution to allow organizations of all sizes to reliably and securely sign their code - without compromising on their agility.
