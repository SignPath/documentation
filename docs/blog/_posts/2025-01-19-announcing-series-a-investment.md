We are quite thrilled to announce that TIN Capital has joined us in our mission to enhance software supply chain security and ensure the integrity of software throughout the entire development process.

This investment represents a significant milestone for SignPath. Since our launch, we’ve gained traction across companies in a wide range of industries on several continents. Now, with the assistance of TIN Capital, we’re ready to embark on our next phase of growth.

The timing couldn’t be better. Organizations are more aware than ever that software breaches can have catastrophic consequences – far beyond the boundaries of any single company. Built on a foundation of advanced code signing, the SignPath code integrity platform secures existing software delivery pipelines from end-to-end and enables organizations to deliver software that’s authenticated, tamper-proof and compliant with industry standards.

[Reinout vander Meulen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/reinoutvandermeulen/), Partner at TIN Capital, explains TIN's investment thesis:

> “We are strong believers in the necessity of robust cybersecurity solutions and the value of European pioneers like SignPath. Both governments and enterprises realize that software breaches have very nasty, far-reaching consequences for users and vendors alike. A single-minded focus on code vulnerabilities is no longer adequate to defend against professional cybercriminals or state actors. We see SignPath’s code signing and pipeline integrity solutions as an essential piece of the puzzle to ensure secure and resilient software supply chains.

TIN Capital’s support will provide the fuel we need to expand the team and scale operations to keep up with demand. Their dedicated cybersecurity expertise and network will enable us to capitalize on the huge potential for growth over the coming two years, while contributing to a more resilient digital future for everyone.

Our CSO, Stephan Brack, commented on the raise, saying:

> We are excited to work with the team at TIN Capital. Leveraging TIN Capital’s expertise and connections across the European cybersecurity ecosystem, on top of our existing network of customer, and strategic partners will open many doors to attract top talent and deliver on the growth we envisage over the coming two years.
