The €5M Series A investment from TIN Capital’s European Cyber Tech Fund will enable SignPath to expand its platform, accelerate its European go-to-market efforts, and grow its customer base in the USA. “This investment is a significant milestone for SignPath,” said Stefan Wenig, CEO and CTO of SignPath. 

> As regulatory requirements like Executive Order 14028 in the U.S., the Cyber Resilience Act in the EU and sector-specific standards evolve, customers increasingly rely on us to ensure the integrity and quality of their software development and security processes. With TIN Capital’s support, we’re positioned to grow our team and scale operations to keep up with demand.

SignPath’s solutions combine automated integrity checks with code signing mechanisms directly into customers’ development pipelines, ensuring all software components are authenticated, tamper-proof, and compliant with industry standards. By streamlining these processes, SignPath enhances security, reliability, and trustworthiness in software products. SignPath has rapidly emerged as a trusted partner for well-known companies, including Hitachi Energy, Airbus, and SolarWinds.

For TIN Capital, this marks the second investment from its European Cyber Tech Fund, one of Europe’s premier cybersecurity funds dedicated to supporting startups and scale-ups.

> “We are strong believers in the necessity of robust cybersecurity solutions and the value of European pioneers like SignPath,” said Reinout vander Meûlen, Partner at TIN Capital. “Both governments and enterprises realize that software breaches have very nasty, far-reaching consequences for users and vendors alike. A single-minded focus on code vulnerabilities is no longer adequate to defend against professional cybercriminals or state actors. We see SignPath’s code signing and pipeline integrity solutions as an essential piece of the puzzle to ensure secure and resilient software supply chains.”
