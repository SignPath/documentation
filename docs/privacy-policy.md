## Cookies

Our website uses so-called “cookies”. Cookies are small text files which are stored on a visitor’s computer or device. There are two main types of cookies: Essential cookies, which are necessary to make a website operational and non-essential cookies, which collect e.g. browsing and usage statistics. While essential cookies are stored automatically on your computer or device based on our legitimate interests, non-essential cookies require your consent.

Some of the cookies used on our website originate from service providers outside the EU (primarily the US). It is therefore possible that some of your data (e.g. IP address, usage behavior, technical data) may be transmitted to the US. According to Court of Justice of the European Union, there is currently no adequate level of data protection in the US. When using cookies from service providers from third countries, we therefore ask for your express consent through our cookie banner.

You are free to revoke your given consent for the use of non-essential cookies and/or cookies from third countries at any time here:

### Google Ads

In order to make our website more attractive, we use Google Ads, a service provided by Google Ireland Limited.
