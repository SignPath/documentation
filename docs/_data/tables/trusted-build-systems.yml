          * Select *My Profile* and [*API Keys*](https://ci.appveyor.com/api-keys)
          * Remember the ① **Bearer token** for the next step
        3. On [SignPath.io](https://app.signpath.io)
          * Navigate to your *project*, scroll down to the *Trusted Build Systems* section and add a link to *AppVeyor*
          * In the dialog, enter the ① **API key** you just acquired
      remarks: SignPath must authenticate against Appveyor to retrieve the build artifacts
    - action: Encrypt the SignPath API token in AppVeyor
      steps: |
        1. On [SignPath.io](https://app.signpath.io)
          * Choose the Users menu and create a new *CI User* or open an existing one
          * Remember the ② **SignPath API token** for the next step
        2. On [ci.appveyor.com](https://ci.appveyor.com)
